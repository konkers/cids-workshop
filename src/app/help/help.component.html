      <h2>Welcome to Cid's Workshop: the FE ÃœberTracker!</h2>
      <p>This tracker aims to be an all in one tracker for
        <a href="http://beta.ff4fe.com/make">Final Fantasy IV: Free Enterprise 0.3.0</a>.
        Currently we support:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Characters, key items, and bosses</li>
        <li>Location and points of interest availability</li>
        <li>Shops with a configurable set of items</li>
        <li>Trapped Chests</li>
        <li>Nk and Nc flags</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More features are planned. See our <a href="https://github.com/konkers/cids-workshop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement">enhancements
          section on GitHub</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For basic character, boss, and key item tracking, chose a location on
        the left, then click on the character, boss, item at the top. The
        tracker will record what you found as well as where you found it. As
        you find key items, more locations and points of interest will unlock.
        Try selecting the <b>Magma Key</b> as your key item at
        <b>Into at Baron</b> and see how all the underworld locations unlock.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more advanced uses (shop items, flags, etc.) check out the
        <b>actions</b> menu at the top right.
